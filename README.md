# Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN

A simple deep-learning project built during the “Deep Learning & Applications” course.  
This implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify static hand-gesture images. The model is trained on a custom dataset and demonstrates gesture recognition performance.

## 🔎 What is this about

Computers, robots or smart devices can work with humans more naturally when they understand hand gestures.  
This project aims to build a system that — given an image of a hand gesture — classifies it correctly.  
It’s useful for sign-language interpretation, touchless interaction, robotics input, and more.
